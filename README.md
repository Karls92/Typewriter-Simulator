# Typewriter Simulator
A really simple and interesting simulation of how to write text with the style of a Typewriter.

Typewriter Simulator consists of an html document where a textarea-type text box is created inside a div element that has a paper-style background image.

With the help of CSS, the text is styled to be very similar to the type of text generated by an old typewriter.

The font used to simulate a typewriter font is: 'Special Elite', cursive - from the google fonts API.
